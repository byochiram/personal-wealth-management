-- ============================================
-- 016 — Account allocations
--
-- Lets users mark "this Rp X in this account is for Y" so emergency
-- fund / goals / sinking funds reflect real account balances instead
-- of being typed-in numbers that drift out of date.
--
-- Each row links one account to one "purpose":
--   - emergency_fund — points to user's emergency_fund row
--   - goal           — points to a specific goals row
--   - sinking_fund   — labeled bucket (e.g., "Liburan Bali", "Pajak Tahunan")
--   - other          — generic
--
-- Sum of allocations on an account should be ≤ account balance.
-- The UI enforces this softly (warning, not hard block — bank balances
-- can fluctuate and we don't want to lock the user out of editing).
